In planning for Singapore’s land use, we take a long-term approach. This is to optimise our limited land, and to ensure the current and future needs of the people are met.

This long-term planning involves broad strategies, identifying land for various needs, and establishing Singapore’s overall development pace. These then lead into planning for the necessary infrastructure and resources to support the proposed land use.

By balancing economic, social and environmental considerations, the goal is to create a sustainable Singapore that provides a quality living environment, offers plentiful growth opportunities and jobs for the people, and safeguards our clean and green landscape.
