This long-term planning involves broad strategies, identifying land for various needs, and establishing Singaporeâ€™s overall development pace. These then lead into planning for the necessary infrastructure and resources to support the proposed land use.

By balancing economic, social and environmental considerations, the goal is to create a sustainable Singapore that provides a quality living environment, offers plentiful growth opportunities and jobs for the people, and safeguards our clean and green landscape.
