To guide Singaporeâ€™s development over the next half a century, the Concept Plan is used to map out our long-term plans for strategic land use and transportation. Its main aim is to ensure there is sufficient land to meet our long-term needs, while ensuring the people continue to enjoy a quality living environment.

The Concept Plan is reviewed every 10 years.
