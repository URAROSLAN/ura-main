**Introduction**

I am very happy to join you this afternoon for this exhibition on the Green Oasis in the City.

I wish we were doing this under more favourable circumstances. But, for now, as all of you know, we are fully focused on dealing with the COVID-19 situation, the virus has broke out in China, and which are dealing with in Singapore. We also know that while we deal with this, life goes on. The work of the Ministries and Government agencies goes on, and that is why we can and we should continue to go on with our lives, so as long as we take extra precautions. That is why we decided to continue with today’s event. It does not constitute a large-scale gathering, but please take precautions – you do not have to shake hands with one another, minimise contact and maintain good hand hygiene, as we have always emphasised. In fact, the current situation reminds us that for a small open city like Singapore, completely linked to the outside world, we will always be exposed to new challenges and threats. We have to keep on staying alert, stay vigilant, anticipate what may come, not just today, but tomorrow– so that we are ready with our responses. And indeed, in dealing with COVID-19, we have been able to respond quickly, partly because of the experience from previous outbreaks like SARS, and because through this experience we have put in place various drawer plans for different scenarios. We also have systems comprising multiple lines of defence.

This forward-looking approach is also what we do for urban planning. This is why we are also always looking at our land use, and putting in place new plans to do better and to make our city greener and more liveable. 

Last year, we announced plans to rejuvenate Orchard Road. We received lots of feedback. Many people were excited about the idea of bringing the ‘Orchard’ back to Orchard Road – so we are making this theme a priority, and today we are sharing with you some plans on how we can go about doing this.
