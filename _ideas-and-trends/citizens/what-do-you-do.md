The Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech) and Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGO) have been exploring the use of virtual assistants (VA) and artificial intelligence (AI) technology to help citizens and businesses navigate online government services and improve service delivery. 

### **What is Ask Jamie?**

Conceptualised in 2014, ‘Ask Jamie’ is a virtual assistant (VA) that can be implemented on agency websites and trained to be able to answer queries within specific domains. To date, Ask Jamie has been implemented across 70 government agency websites. The VA technology helps to provide direct responses to citizens who prefer to search for information online, and in turn, manpower can be re-directed to handle more complex queries and issues.
