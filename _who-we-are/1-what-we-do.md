At URA, we adopt a long-term and comprehensive planning approach to formulate strategic plans such as the Concept Plan and the Master Plan to guide the physical development of Singapore in a sustainable manner. Our plans and policies are focused on achieving a quality living environment for Singapore.

To turn plans and visions into reality, we take on a multi-faceted role. We evaluate and grant planning approvals for developments through our Development Control, Urban Design and Conservation guidelines. The guidelines facilitate orderly development and ensure that developments are compatible with the neighbourhood, in line with the longerâ€“term planning intentions for the site.

In addition to our planning function, we are also the main government land sales agent. Through the sale of State land, we attract and channel private capital investment to develop sites to support economic and social objectives. As the conservation authority, we have an internationally recognised conservation programme, and have successfully conserved not just single buildings, but entire districts. We also partner the community to enliven our public spaces to create a car-lite, people-friendly and liveable city for all to enjoy.

In shaping a distinctive city, we promote architecture and urban design excellence, and innovate to build a resilient city of opportunity that fulfils the aspirations of our people.
